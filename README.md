#NvChad 2.5
My personal configuration with nvchad 2.5

nvim cheat sheet
-------------------------------------

- df 'c' (delete including 'c')

- use dt 'c', where c is any character, e.g. for you, you want dt"
  - This will delete upto but not including c.

- leader ra (lsp nvrenamer)

- null-ls replacement: formatter.nvim & nvim-lint
  - OR... none-ls!
